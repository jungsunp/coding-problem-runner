### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jungsunp/dsa-problem-runner.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   - [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other preferred C# IDE)

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

4. Navigate to the desired problem directory and run the solution using the appropriate command (e.g., `dotnet run` for console applications).

### Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific category or topic of coding problems. Here's an example structure:

```
dsa-problem-runner/
├── arrays/
│   ├── problem1.cs
│   ├── problem2.cs
│   └── README.md
├── strings/
│   ├── problem1.cs
│   ├── problem2.cs
│   └── README.md
├── linked-lists/
│   ├── problem1.cs
│   ├── problem2.cs
│   └── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

Each problem directory contains the following files:

- `problem1.cs`, `problem2.cs`, etc.: These files contain the solution code for the respective coding problems.
- `README.md`: This file provides a brief description of the problems and any additional information or resources related to the topic.
